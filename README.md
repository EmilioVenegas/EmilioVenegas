# Hi, I'm Emilio Venegas 👋

I am a Biosciences student at Tecnológico de Monterrey with a strong focus on computational biology, 3D printing, and AI in medicine.

- 🤖 **My main project is [ATOMICA-Diffusion-Antibiotic-Design](https://github.com/EmilioVenegas/ATOMICA-Diffusion-Antibiotic-Design)**, a unified pipeline for *de novo* antibiotic design. I developed an SE(3) equivariant cross-attention mechanism to condition the DiffSBDD generative model on ATOMICA's interaction embeddings.
- 🔬 Currently a Research Intern at **Dr. Shrike Zhang's Lab** (Harvard Medical School / BWH), where I engineer biomimetic models using microfluidics and advanced 3D printing (DLP, tomographic).
- 🧬 My research background includes cancer biology (investigating allicin effects in 3D spheroid models) and developing deep learning classifiers for mammographic images (CancerSense).
- 🏆 Gold Medalist at the Iberoamerican Chemistry Olympiad and Bronze Medalist at the International Chemistry Olympiad.
